 Que1:: what are closures? give an example of closures
Ans :: A closure is the combination of a function bundled together with references to its
       surrounding state. In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer 
        function's scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function
        is created, at function creation time

function Welcome(name) {
  var Info = function (message) {
    console.log(message + " " + name);
  };
  return Info;
}
var myFunction = Welcome("John");
myFunction("Welcome "); 
myFunction("Hello Mr.");

Que2:: what are the objects.
Ans::objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or 
      reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
      ex: 
      let college = {
            Name : "shivaji college",
            location : "Morshi"
      }


que3::explain prototype.
ans::java script is a prototype based language whenever we creat a function using javascript ,
javascript engine adds a prototype property inside a function ,prototype property besically is
an objectwhere we can attached methods and properties in a prototype object which anable all 
the other object so inherites these method and property


que4::what is prototype chain.
ans::Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to 
inheritance in a class based language.The prototype on object instance is available through Object.
getPrototypeOf(object) or (proto) property whereas prototype on constructors function is available
through Object.prototype.

 que5::what are call back?
 ans::A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument. This function is invoked
  inside the outer function to complete an action. Let's take a simple example of how to use callback function


function print(name) {
    console.log('Hi' + ' ' + name);
}

print('sanket');
